ATT:
Honest apology for 'hard coded' data in my previous repo. This is something that will never be repeated again

Words of appreciation: I Personally appreciate this apportunity and more so the support that I got when I was stuck. It shows clearly how organised and supportive the team is, I appreciate the help

Finally: I will STRIVE to make sure Parts_asignment has all the features requested and much more.

I have identified issues with the data that I need some more time to fix. i.e duplicate data in my csv file
I am aware that "One hot encoding feature" is missing. It is something new to me but with some more time I can do it
